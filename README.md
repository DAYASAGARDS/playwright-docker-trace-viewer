# Playwright Docker Trace Viewer

This document explains how to use the Dockerfile to build and run a Playwright Trace Viewer server in a Docker container.

## Overview

The Dockerfile creates a container with:
- Node.js 18
- Playwright repository
- Chromium browser
- Playwright Trace Viewer configured to run on port 8080

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Docker commands

## Uses
[Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) 

## Building the Docker Image

1. Save the Dockerfile to your project directory
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile
3. Build the image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t playwright-trace-viewer .
```

This will create a Docker image named `playwright-trace-viewer`.

## Running the Container

Run the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --rm --init playwright-trace-viewer
```

Where:
- `-p 8080:8080` maps the container's port 8080 to your host's port 8080

## Accessing the Trace Viewer

Once the container is running:

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
3. Use the interface to load and view your Playwright trace files

## Viewing Trace Files

To view a specific trace file:

`Just drag and Drop`

To view a remote trace file. 
```bash
http://localhost:8080/trace/index.html?trace=https://demo.playwright.dev/reports/todomvc/data/fa874b0d59cdedec675521c21124e93161d66533.zip
```

## Stopping the Container

To stop the running container:

1. Find the container ID using `docker ps`
2. Run `docker stop <container-id>`

## Additional Information

- This container exposes the Playwright Trace Viewer on port 8080
- The Trace Viewer helps debug and analyze Playwright test runs
- You can use this container to view trace files generated by Playwright tests
- For more information about Playwright Trace Viewer, visit [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer)

## Troubleshooting

- If you can't access the Trace Viewer, ensure port 8080 is not being used by another application
- If you have issues with permissions, check the ownership and permissions of your trace files directory
